## Description 

This is a simple logo generator that generates SVG files containing a logo based on user input. The user can choose a shape for the logo(triangle, circle or square), enter up to three characters of text, and choose the color of the shape and text. The application will then generate a logo matching the specifications.

## Learning Points 

This project reinforced my knowledge of the Object Oriented Programming paradigm and also introduced me to Scalable Vector Graphics. I think the biggest learning point was testing, and I want to focus more on a Test Driven Development approach in future projects.
